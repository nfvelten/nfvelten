I am an experienced TypeScript software developer with expertise developing, maintaining, and documenting full-stack applications.

I am involved in numerous stages of development, from the architecture and design of new systems through the provisioning of visible and highly-available cloud infrastructure.

Always valuing excellent programming principles such as TDD, Clean and Hex Arch, DDD, and using agile approaches such as SCRUM and Kanban for better management and increased productivity
